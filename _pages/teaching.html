<p style="text-align: justify;">During reversible ion insertion, intercalation material lattices undergo structural changes, resulting in strains and volume change that lead to structural degradation and cycle limitations. Inspired by shape-memory alloys, which undergo substantial lattice transformations while maintaining minimal macroscopic volume changes or internal stress, I develop a theoretical framework for forecasting structural transformation in intercalation compounds. This framework highlights design principles to create microstructures resembling shape-memory characteristics in intercalation materials</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After evaluating 5,000 pairs of compounds, the findings suggest that Spinel Li<sub>x</sub>Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> is a promising candidate, emphasizing a direct correlation between structural transformations, microstructures, and enhanced capacity retention in these materials. In summary, designing intercalation materials with customized crystallographic characteristics offers a promising approach to discovering compounds that maintain their performance over extended use</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Batteries are now used in very high volumes of everyday applications such as powering mobile phones, laptops and other portable electronic devices. These batteries are promising candidates for sustainable energy storage, although their use in high energy density applications, like powering electric vehicles, is still a challenge. A key limitation of the battery performance is the structural instability of battery materials with continuous usage and increased energy density requirements. Our central aim is to crystallographically and microstructurally engineer battery materials, such as electrodes, solid-electrolytes, in order to enhance energy storage capacity and lifespan. In our group, we use martensite crystallographic theory and phase-field methods, to design a new generation of <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prmaterials/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.3.065404">battery</a> electrodesâ€”which offers minimum volume changes, enhanced conductivity and longer lifespans.</p>
