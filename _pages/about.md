Welcome to my website! I'm Delin (pronounced like Dylan), an enthusiastic Ph.D. candidate at [Department of Aerospace & Mechanical Engineering](https://ame.usc.edu/), [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/). My research is centered around computational materials, with a primary focus on finite element methods, phase field modeling, crystallographic theory, and structural failure analysis.
